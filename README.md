# Rob-Clip

Small Clipboard history application in Go.
So I can try the [bubbleTea framework](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)

## Goals

## TODO

-   Re-Structure the project (WIP)
-   When enter on the list, set the old value to the clipboard
-   Daemon with a command ?
    -   Update command ? That will pull the last release from Github ?
-   Unit Test ??
